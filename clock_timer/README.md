# Clock Timer

A Python project that simulates a countdown timer. The user specifies the countdown time, 
and the program counts down, displaying the remaining seconds.

## How to Run

To run the timer:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `clock_timer` directory.
3. Use the following command to start the timer:
   ```bash
   python clock_timer.py <countdown_time_in_seconds>

CI/CD Integration
This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow (clock_timer.yaml) to test the script in a CI/CD pipeline.
